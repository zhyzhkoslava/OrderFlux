 *   - When a null (or blank string) is passed to the constructor or parse(), ex. new Carbon(null)
 *   - When the string "now" is passed to the constructor or parse(), ex. new Carbon(\'now\')
 *   - When a string containing the desired time is passed to Carbon::parse().
 *
 * It will also align default timezone (e.g. call date_default_timezone_set()) with
